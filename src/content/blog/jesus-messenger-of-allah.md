## Question:

This question includes Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) which the Qadianis (a deviant sect) quote as evidence for their opinion. They say that ‘Isa (Jesus) is dead and buried. I hope you will explain these Ayahs and refute their claims.

In the first Ayah is the saying of Allah (Exalted be He):
> “The Messiah [‘Isâ (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a Siddîqah [i.e. she believed in the Words of Allâh and His Books (see Verse 66:12)]. They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allâh does not eat).” [Qur'an, Al-Maidah: 75]

## Answer: 

The wisdom behind this Ayah is refuting the claims of those who say, as in the Qur’an: “**Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allâh is the Messiah**” [Qur'an, Al-Maidah: 17] and: “**Allâh is the third of the three (in a Trinity).**” [Qur'an, Al-Maidah: 73]. 

It also refutes the Saying of those who claim that ‘Isa is the son of Allah. It explains that the Christ ‘Isa (Jesus - peace be upon him) is not a lord or a god. In fact it proves that he is a mere Messenger whom Allah honored with this Message. He is like all the Messengers who were sent before him. He had a limited life span. 

This Ayah, however, does not say when he will die. Other evidence from the Qur’an and the Sunnah explains that ‘Isa was raised alive to Allah and that he (peace be upon him) will descend and judge justly among the people, then he will die at the end of time. Allah says that `Isa and his mother Mary (peace be upon them both) used to eat food. This indicates that they were not gods because they were in need of food to stay alive.

But Allah (Exalted be He) is the Self-sufficient One with Absolute Might. All other beings need Him and He is not in need of any of them. The meaning of this Ayah is explained by the preceding and succeeding Ayahs, as mentioned previously.

This Ayah is preceded by Allah’s saying: “**Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allâh is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary).**” [Qur'an, Al-Maidah: 17] And: “**Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allâh is the third of the three (in a Trinity).**” [Qur'an, Al-Maidah: 73] After these Ayahs, some Ayahs follow prohibiting exaggeration in religious matters, denying worship of anything other than Allah, cursing whoever worships anyone other than Allah and whoever accepts this without denying it.

Also the following Ayah from Surah (Qur'anic chapter) Al-An`am explains this: ”**Say (O Muhammad (peace be upon him)): “Shall I take as a Walî (Helper, Protector, Lord or God) any other than Allâh, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? And it is He Who feeds but is not fed.”**” [Qur'an, Al-An’am: 14]
